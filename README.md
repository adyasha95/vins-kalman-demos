# Visual-Inertial Navigation System (VINS) Basics â€“ Kalman Filter Demos

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`vns.ipynb`) with beginner-friendly simulations of **Kalman Filters**, designed to build intuition for **Visual-Inertial Navigation Systems (VINS)**.

---

## ðŸš€ Contents
- **1D Kalman Filter**  
  Simulates a car moving at constant velocity with noisy GPS-like measurements.  
  Shows how the Kalman Filter fuses predictions and measurements to reduce noise.

- **2D State Model (Position + Velocity)**  
  Extends to a matrix form where the state includes both position and velocity.  
  Demonstrates how uncertainty propagates and how updates refine the estimate.

- **Plots & Visualizations**  
  Each simulation produces plots comparing:
  - True position/trajectory
  - Noisy sensor measurements
  - Kalman Filter estimates
